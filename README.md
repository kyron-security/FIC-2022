# FIC-2022
Code generated to perform cybersecurity attack on an industrial system (OT) during the International Forum of Cybersecurity held in 2022.
The demonstration was hosted on Fortinet/KYRON booth for the 3 days of the Forum.
We had many visitors to see us and the demonstration. I decided to write an article for MISC Magazine and to provide all the sources generated to attack the industrial system.

I will add the link to the MISC article as soon as it is published.

# FIC-2022
Code generated to perform cybersecurity attack on an industrial system (OT) during the International Forum of Cybersecurity held in 2022.
The demonstration was hosted on Fortinet/KYRON booth for the 3 days of the Forum.
We had many visitors to see us and the demonstration. I decided to write an article for MISC Magazine and to provide all the sources generated to attack the industrial system.

I will add the link to the MISC article as soon as it is published.

You will find all the scripts under the folder "scripts".
The main script is the pyhton "hackit.py".
All shell scripts are calling the python script to work.

You will find some photos and screenshots under the folder "photos"

Enjoy !
